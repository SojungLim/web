<strong>Knitting</strong><br>
Knitting is a method by which yarn is manipulated to create a textile or fabric; it is used in many types of garments. Knitting may be done by hand or by machine.<br><br>
<strong>Knitting skills</strong><br>
<u>Continental knitting</u>, also called German knitting, European knitting, or left-hand knitting, is the process of knitting by holding the yarn in the hand opposite the working needle (i.e. the left hand if the knitter is right-handed). However, use of the term 'left-hand knitting' is discouraged by left-handed knitters because it leads to misunderstandings.<br><br>

<u>English knitting</u>, also known as right-hand knitting or throwing, is a style of Western knitting where the yarn to be knit into the fabric is carried in the right hand. This style is prevalent throughout the English-speaking world, though it is by no means universal.
